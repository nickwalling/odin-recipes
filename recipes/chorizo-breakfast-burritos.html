        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>¾ pound chorizo sausage, casings removed and crumbled</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped red onion</li>
            <li>1 green chile pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously coat a large frying pan with cooking spray. 
                Cook and stir chorizo in the prepared pan over medium-high 
                heat until well browned and crumbled. Add onion and chile 
                pepper; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onion 
                is tender.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a medium bowl and add to chorizo mixture. Reduce 
                heat to medium-low; continue cooking and stirring until eggs 
                are scrambled and no longer runny.</li>
            <li>Warm flour tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds. Spoon 
                chorizo-egg mixture into the middle of each tortilla and top 
                with shredded Cheddar cheese. Roll up like a burrito.</li>
        </ol>
