        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fish batter recipe makes the lightest, crispiest batter imaginable! 
            I got this recipe on an open-line, talk-radio show in the early 1950s 
            and it has been a family favorite ever since. It makes enough to coat 
            approximately 2 pounds of fish.</p>
        <p>This fish batter recipe ensures flavorful and crispy fried fish that's 
            surprisingly simple to make at home. The batter is seasoned with salt and 
            you can add additional spices like paprika or seafood seasoning for an 
            additional boost of flavor, if desired. You can use this batter to fry 
            fish for pub-style fish and chips or fish tacos. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, milk, water, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl 
                until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable or canola oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F 
                (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pat fish fillets dry with paper towels to help ensure batter sticks; 
                dip fish fillets into the batter to coat.</li>
            <li>Carefully lower fillets, one at a time, into hot oil. Fry several fillets 
                at a time without overcrowding the pan, turning once, until cooked through 
                and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Drain fried fish fillets on a wire rack over a paper-towel lined pan.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
