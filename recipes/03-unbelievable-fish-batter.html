            <h2 class="description-title">Description</h2>
            <p>This fish batter recipe makes the lightest, crispiest batter imaginable! 
                I got this recipe on an open-line, talk-radio show in the early 1950s 
                and it has been a family favorite ever since. It makes enough to coat 
                approximately 2 pounds of fish.</p>
            <p>This fish batter recipe ensures flavorful and crispy fried fish that's 
                surprisingly simple to make at home. The batter is seasoned with salt and 
                you can add additional spices like paprika or seafood seasoning for an 
                additional boost of flavor, if desired. You can use this batter to fry 
                fish for pub-style fish and chips or fish tacos. </p>

            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li id="step-one">Gather ingredients.</li>
                <li id="step-two">Whisk flour, milk, water, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl 
                    until smooth.</li>
                <li id="step-three">Heat vegetable or canola oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F 
                    (185 degrees C).</li>
                <li id="step-one">Pat fish fillets dry with paper towels to help ensure batter sticks; 
                    dip fish fillets into the batter to coat.</li>
                <li id="step-two">Carefully lower fillets, one at a time, into hot oil. Fry several fillets 
                    at a time without overcrowding the pan, turning once, until cooked through 
                    and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
                <li id="step-three">Drain fried fish fillets on a wire rack over a paper-towel lined pan.</li>
                <li id="step-one">Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
