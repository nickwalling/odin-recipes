        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This one-pan creamy chicken and vegetable pasta can be on the 
            table in about 30 minutes. Leftover chicken and any combination 
            of fresh vegetables you like combine with a made-in-the-pan sour 
            cream and Parmesan sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons plus 1 pinch salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>12 ounces dried ziti</li>
            <li>2 cups mixed fresh vegetables, such as asparagus, matchstick 
                carrots and sliced onions</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken soup base, such as Better than Bouillon®</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 packed cup chopped fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>fresh basil sprigs for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add panko and 
                a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden 
                brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the Dutch oven and set aside. 
                Wipe out the pot with paper towels.</li>
            <li>To the same pot, over medium-high heat, add 3 1/2 cups water, 
                and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Add 12 ounces ziti and stir 
                to combine. Boil uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 
                6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in vegetables, garlic, herb seasoning, soup base, and pepper; 
                return to a boil. Cook until pasta and vegetables are barely tender, 
                and the water is nearly gone, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and spinach, and cook about 1 minute longer. Remove 
                from heat. Stir in sour cream and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Place mixture into a serving bowl and drizzle with olive oil. 
                Top with reserved panko, garnish with fresh basil, and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
